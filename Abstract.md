## Evaluating Caches with multiple caching strategies ##

Caching is one of the easiest ways to increase system performance. Data transfer rates from memory can be slow and as you already know, speed is the name of the game. There are several strategies and choosing the right one can make a big difference. Your caching strategy depends severely on the data and data access patterns. Current data cache organizations fail to deliver high performance in scalar processors for many different applications. Stating for example that spatial locality of cached blocks is largely ignored, and only temporal locality is considered in current system buffer cache managements. Therefore through the project we are aiming to implement and evaluate the various caching techniques we came across during the lecture, basically their real time application on the basis of data size and data count and compare the different caching strategies. We plan to implement spatial and temporal localities. We also aim to implement LRU for the various caching techniques and also for spatial and temporal localities. Along with this we will study two caching techniques â€“ annex and victim cache and try to implement it as well. As we know effective caching aids both content consumers and content providers and so our project aims to convert our theoretical knowledge into practical analysis and comparison.
